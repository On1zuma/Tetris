# Tetris Game


Welcome to my Tetris game project! This game is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 
The objective of the game is to rotate and move different shaped blocks, known as tetrominoes, in order to create complete horizontal lines without gaps. 
Each time a player completes a line, it will disappear and the player will earn points. The game gets progressively harder as the player earns more points.
